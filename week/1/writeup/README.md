After finding the security issues in the firmware, I'd want to tell my boss. Before I tell my boss, I'd consult people I knew I could trust beforehand. I'd want second opinions on my data and also advice on how to go about informing my boss.

I'd be very careful about who I share my discoveries with. Even if I had intelligent coworkers whose insights I respected, I'd be considerate of the fact the information could be retold by people incorrectly. I don't want my words to get twisted. If I have important data that I intend to show my boss, I'd want it to be displayed correctly and come directly from me.

If, after going to my boss, I'm told the situation will be handled, I'd want to be apart of fixing the security issues. Even if I cannot directly help, I'd follow up with whatever team is working on it and let it be known I'm willing to be proactive in seeing the process through.

If my company is unwilling to postpone the ECU release, I'd feel like it's out of my control and not my responsibility to push my ideas forward. I'd only feel partly responsible if harm occurred and I hadn't said *anything* to *anyone*. However, I wouldn't take responsibility if I told someone above me and it was their decision to not go forward with it.

Despite believing it's not my job to push forward after being rejected, I still wouldn't want people to be injured from something I could've prevented. Because of this, I would still be driven to push my discoveries forward. I'd be doing this for my own emotional reasons (i.e. caring about someone being injured because of this) and not because it's my job to.

After the postpone is rejected, I'd be more open to showing others what I've concluded about the firmware. I'd tell coworkers so they could get involved. After getting more people to agree with me and gathering opinions on how to continue onward, I'd try again to reason with the company that it's important this postpone takes place. If, after all of this, it's still rejected, that is as far as I'd go.
