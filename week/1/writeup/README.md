I'd be very careful about who I share my conclusion with. Even if I had intelligent coworkers whom I got along with and respected, I'd be considerate of the fact the information could be retold by people incorrectly. I don't want my words to get twisted. Even worse, I wouldn't want it to turn into office gossip.

If I have important data, I'd want it to be displayed correctly and from my own words. That way, there'd be no grey area and I could be positive it's explained the way I want it to.

I'd go to my boss about the situation; that'd be something I'd decide right away. However, I'd consult people I knew I could trust beforehand. I wouldn't talk to them specifically about what I discovered, instead I'd speak generally about the best way to conduct myself in front of my boss so they take me and what I'm saying seriously.

After going to my boss, even if they let me know they'll handle it I wouldn't be hands off and turn my cheek to the situation. Instead, I'd be sure to follow up with them so they're aware I'm willing to be proactive in seeing the process through.

If my company is unwilling to postpone the ECU release, I'd feel like it's out of my control and not my responsibility to push my ideas forward. However, thinking more emotionally, I wouldn't want people to be injured from something I could've prevented. Because of this, I would be more driven to push my discoveries forward so no one had to be harmed from something I could've prevented.

After the rejection to postpone, I'd be more open to showing others what I've concluded about the firmware. I'd tell coworkers so they could get involved. After getting more people to agree with me and opinions on how to continue onward, I'd try to use the more voices as a way to reason with the company that it's important.

I'd feel responsible if harm occurs and I hadn't say *anything* to *anyone*. However, I won't feel responsible if I told someone and it was their decision to not go forward with it. I'm not the head of the company, I'm not my own boss, I don't have a high position in the ECU, etc. Even if I cared emotionally, I don't think it's on my shoulders to do everything I can and risk it all to postpone the release.
