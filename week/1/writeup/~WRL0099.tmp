I'd be very particular about who I share the information with. Even if I had intelligent coworkers whom I got along with, I'd be too anxious the information would turn into office gossip. Being the person I am, I'd also be anxious that someone would debunk my conclusion and I'd be pinned to look like an idiot in front of everyone. Admitting this isn't the best thing, because I don't want to be so self-absorbed into my image while a real issue could be taking place. But if I had a good job as a junior developer, I wouldn't want that or any future opportunities to be tarnished. So I'd definitely have a selfish aspect into what decision I'd make in regards to who I tell.

I'd go to my boss for sure. That'd be something I'd decide right away. However, I'd consult people I knew I could trust beforehand. Perhaps my father, who has worked in IT for many years and has had more experience than me in an office setting. I'd also consult someone who I know is good at being confident/standing their ground when delivering a message, even if they aren't a tech person. This is because I wouldn't want to show any insecurities in my discover and let my boss talk me out of what I've uncovered or doubt the data. 

If my boss lets me know they'll handle it or they'll get back to me about it, I'd wager how much time I'd give them before expecting a response. If that amount of time I decided on passes, I'd reach back out to them for a follow up. I'd do this so they're aware I haven't just brushed it off. 

If my company is unwilling to postpone it, I'd feel like it's out of my control. I can't take on an entire company. At that point, I'd tell other people who are relevant and can get involved. I'd be more open to showing what I've concluded about the firmware. After getting more people to agree with me, I'd try to use the more voices as a way to reason with the company that it's important. 

The way I view it, I'd feel responsible if harm occurs and I hadn't say anything. But I don't know if I'd feel responsible if I told someone and it was their decision to not go forward with it. I'm not the head of the company, I'm not my own boss, I don't have a high position in the ECU, etc. So I don't think it's on my shoulders to start a war against the company to push this. 

Thinking emotionally though, I wouldn't want people to be injured from something I could've prevented, so I would be very driven to push my discoveries forward so no one had to be harmed from something I could've prevented.
