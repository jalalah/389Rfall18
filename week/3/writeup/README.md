## Assignment 3 Writeup

### Part 1 (100 pts)

Fred Kruegster,

Thanks for reaching out! I've compiled a list of some actions you can take to give your website, as well as your online accounts in general, better security.

### * Open ports

I was able to access the associated server (admin page) of your website through an open port. Open ports are dangerous because they're an attack surface. They can expose information about you and your system that you do not want out there. Basically, they're a huge potential security leak.

Because of these reason, you want to be sure you don't have any open ports on your website. 

### * Passwords

We all want passwords we can remember. But at the same time, we don't want it to be so easy anyone can come up with the passwords we've chosen. We also don't want to choose passwords that involve well known things people know we love. These include hobbies, pet names, favorite sports team, etc.

Let's take your password for example: pokemon

On you Instagram, 99% of what you posted about were Pokemon (Pokemen?). Also, on your Twitter you retweeted something pertaining to Pokemon. If I am trying to hack into your system, I'm going to start with passwords that are common/what I believe you'd pick. I don't even have to know you personally to think of Pokemon; all I would have to do is look at your social media accounts.

You can choose a password like pokemon if you alter the spelling and also make it into a longer phrase using numbers, capital letters, and symbols. Here are a few examples:

1. ire11yLOVEp0K3mOn
2. P0K3MON1sMYf@vor!t3
3. p0KEM0N!$0gr34T!

These are phrases that would be easy for you to remember, but they're written in a way that's difficult for people to think up of. They're also phrases that wouldn't be on a basic password list like rockyou.txt (which is the list I used to hack into your system).

### * Firewalls

An even further security practice that will help ensure your site is secure is using a firewall. A firewall can block unauthorized access to your website. Think of it like a security guard and your website is the door this security person is guarding. The security gaurd (firewall) will act as someone who turns away unauthorized visitors to that door (website).

Luckily, there are plenty of guides/tutorials that can help you set up a firewall on your website by yourself!

### Wrap Up

I was able to get as far as I did into your website because of an open port, a weak password, and the personal information (plane ticket) you posted on your instagram (have fun in San Francisco this winter:) ). Even if I got into the port, if you had a really strong password I wouldn't have been able to get any further. If I did so happen to still crack your password, if you hadn't posted your plane ticket online, I wouldn't have been able to know exactly which .txt file pertained to your flight.

We have social media accounts so people can see things we post. But you have to be mindful about what you put out there and the potential danger people can do with your information. Don't make yourself an easy target!
