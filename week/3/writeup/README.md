### Part 1 (100 pts)

Fred Kruegster,

Thanks for reaching out! I've compiled a short list of actions you can take to give your website, as well as your online accounts in general, better security.

* Passwords
We all want passwords we can remember. But at the same time, we don't want it to be so easy anyone can come up with the passwords we've chosen. We don't want to choose passwords that involve obvious things we like, hobbies, pet names, kid names, spouse names, etc.

Let's take your password for example: pokemon
On you Instagram, 99% of what you posted about were Pokemon (Pokemen?). Also, on your Twitter you retweeted something pertaining to Pokemon. If I am trying to
hack into your system, I'm going to start with passwords that are common/what I believe you'd pick. I don't even have to know you personally to think of Pokemon; all I would have to do is look at your social media accounts.

You can choose a password like pokemon if you alter the spelling and also make it into a longer phrase using numbers, capitol letters, and symbols. Here are a few examples:
1. ire11yLOVEp0K3mOn
2. P0K3MON1sMYf@vor!t3
3. p0KEM0N!$0gr34T!

These are phrases that would be easy for you to remember, but they're written in a way that's difficult for people to think up of. They're also phrases that wouldn't be on a basic password list like rockyou.txt (which is the list I used to hack into your system).

Another thing, make sure you have different passwords across several accounts. And write your passwords down *on paper*. That is the safest place to keep them. If someone is able to get ahold of your phone or laptop where your passwords are saved on a word file, you don't want all your accounts to be compromised.

* Open ports
I was able to access the admin server on your website through an open port. Open ports are dangerous because they're an attack surface. They can expose information about you and your system that you do not want out there. Basically, they're a huge potential security leak.

I was able to get as far as I did through this open port because of your weak password and also because of the personal information (plane ticket) you posted on your instagram (have fun in Malaysia this winter:) ). There is no way for a port to be completely secure, however, you want to take every step you can to protect your website. Even if I got into the port, if you had a really strong password I wouldn't have been able to get any further.
And if you hadn't posted your plane ticket online, I wouldn't have been able to know exactly which .txt file pertained to your flight.
We have social media accounts so people can see things we post. But you have to be mindful about what you put out there and the potential danger people can do with your information.

* Further Security Practices
Passwords can still be cracked and ports can still be exploited. Taking even further security practices will help ensure your site is secure. These practices can make it so if your site does get broken into, you can be notified of the security breach.
A firewall can block unauthorized access to your website. It'll notify you of someone trying to break into your system. If you are not tech savvy yourself, you could also hire someone to manage your website and keep it secure for you. However, there are plenty of guides/tutorials that can help you secure your website by yourself.
